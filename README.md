# Solidity experimentation

- https://bscscan.com/token/0x8b9e3c45911e222a6df9f0cc527418f0a6452582 deployed a smart contract on the bsc network!
- Can do the same for ethereum (or any EVM compatible chain) but gas fee too expensives
- Created a basic website NFT mini app with a backend, smart contracts and a frontend. Connect via rinkeby
test network (then refresh), connect wallet. Then you will see the nft with an ID of 0. I also randomly generated
the 6 Brotatos using the nft-generator tool.

# In Progress:
- Uniswap fork (backend completed) need to learn more web3.js to connect a frontend
- CryptoPunks clone, create the 10,000 original cryptopunks and a React app for minting and displaying them

# Next:
- Create an NFT marketplace for the 10,000 CryptoPunks
- Clone a Defi yield aggregator farm, run it myself to get a better understanding of how it works
- Clone a algorithmic stablecoin
